#  jrnl
jrnl is a cli tool for writing a journal.
It is not intended to be another zettelkasten application or a note taking app,
although it uses the power commonmark markdown and thus could be used as a
zettelkasten.

It strives to have no dependencies, just pure standard stable rust and to be a
single executable without clutter.

This is why the manual and the default config are hardcoded into the executable.

## Goals
Be a viable open source rust written digital journal writing app. Using plain
text files.

## Non-Goals
Replace all valuable zettelkasten or note taking apps.
